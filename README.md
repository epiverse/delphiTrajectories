# delphiTrajectories
Using [Delphi 2M model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09529-3)* in-browser for privacy preserving estimation of morbidity risk for individual health trajectories. This is primarily an exploratory exercise in engineering privacy-preserving applications backed by generative transformers. Live prototype under development at [epiverse.github.io/delphiTrajectories](https://epiverse.github.io/delphiTrajectories) .
